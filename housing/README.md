# How can I build one?

## Parts list
- Power Source using a LiFePo4 [battery](https://www.bioennopower.com/collections/12v-series-lifepo4-batteries) 
  - advantages from bioenno power is they are ham friendly company
    - we can re-use the shipping foam
  - Anderson and external charge/solar can be done while in operation
  - plug and play operations all sub $99USD will fit inside the case
- _Plastic_ `MTM Ammo Can 30 Caliber Tall` also called `0.30 Caliber Ammo Box`
  - found via just about any retailer or harbor freight, online.
  - plastic for SWR and use of GPS chip without external mounting
- Bulkhead Connector and pig-tail
  - Decide if you want BNC(UHF/PL-259) or SMA external port
  - search for `SMA Male to SMA Female Bulkhead Pigtail`
  - or search for `SMA Male to BNC male bulkhead`
    - PL259 to BNC Adapter on outside BNC

The only hole cut is for the antenna port the rest is stored internal. The packaging the bioenno battery comes in will come in handy for also protecting the battery in the ammo can. The RTG unit will just fit anywhere. I like to spot-weld with hot-glue-gun the GPS into the lid where it fits nicely with a little hot glue.
